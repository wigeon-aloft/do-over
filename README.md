# Do-over
Do-over is a script that does some admin tasks to configure a Manjaro machine to my liking following a fresh installation.
- Install packages I use frequently
- Configure KDE settings, including:
    - Window behaviours
    - Window decorations
    - Global theme
    - Fonts
    - Task switcher

## Usage
Run the `setup` script.

```
chmod +x ./setup
./setup
```
